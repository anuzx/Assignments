// Problem Description – Time-Limited Async Function

// You are given an asynchronous function and a time limit t in milliseconds.
// Your task is to wrap this function so that it either resolves normally if it completes within the given time or rejects
// with the message "Time Limit Exceeded" if execution takes longer than t.
function timeLimit(fn, t) {
   return function (...args) {
     return Promise.race([
       fn(...args),
       new Promise((_, reject) =>
         setTimeout(() => reject("Time Limit Exceeded"), t),
       ),
     ]);
   };
}

//Promise.race returns a Promise that settles as soon as the FIRST promise settles (resolve or reject).

module.exports = timeLimit;
